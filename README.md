# Summoners of the Multiverse

We built our game with Pokemon Red and Blue in mind, where to "catch them all", you have to have both games or trade with players of the other version, ie. Red players have to trade with Blue players.

In Summoners of the Multiverse, players have to "hunt" in both chains to get every guardian and variations of guardians. If they don't want to go cross chain but intend to collect every single guardian in the game, they will have to utilise our marketplace (soon tm), where Axelar can facilitate the cross chain transactions.

Other than that, equipped guardians are different on different chains. Bridge your Guardians across the chains to assemble your best teams on each chain!


## Notes

1. Supports both Desktop and Mobile (you can use Metamask Mobile to access)
2. Only supports Metamask wallets for now


## Development

1. use ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
2. use ```npm start``` to run the local dev environment.
